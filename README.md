# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
A timed quiz that will load onto the webpage and dynamically respond to the quiz-takers input.

The quiz will also store the users score and name, then subsequently add it to the High Scores list. 

If the user runs out of time organically, or causes the timer to hit zero due to negative answers, they 
will receive a "Times up!" message and be invited to try again.

Please see the below link and screenshot for the quiz:
