# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
A timed quiz that will load onto the webpage and dynamically respond to the quiz-takers input.

The quiz will also store the users score and name, then subsequently add it to the High Scores list. 

If the user runs out of time organically, or causes the timer to hit zero due to negative answers, they 
will receive a "Times up!" message and be invited to try again.

Please see the below link and screenshot for the quiz:

**IMPORTANT NOTE FROM REPOSITORY OWNER**
This assignment was, by far, one of the most challenging tasks I have ever tried to do. 
It was not simply testing in sheer knowledge comprehension, but also in confidence, will-power, 
and (crucially so) time management. 

I am embarressed to admit that my own attempt's to satisfy the assigment requirements and create 
the quiz on my own all ultimately failed. Despite re-watching all week 4 classes, meeting with my 
tutor, meeting with classmates, attempting to follow along with several online Youtube tutorials
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQr4O1OITJo is one, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fB9Xg2JEY 
is another), and devoting ~22 hours overall this past week to the assigment, I could simply not come 
up with a viable solution or strategy that was on par with what we have covered so far. 
My previous code should be visible in GitHub via historical commits. 

Ironically, despite trying to avoid simply mimicking what was shown in the tutorials mentioned previously
I am ashamed to admit that I have borrowed heavily from fellow classmate Erik Portillo. Using his repository
https://github.com/rasputinforever/Quiz-Game , and in order to submit some form of "satisfactory" code for 
the homework assignment, I created a clone of his functional quiz and made certan design elemental changes
to more fit my style. However, the vast majority of the code was layed out and commented by Erik Portillo.

Due to this failure in comprehension, I will accept any grade that is seen to be fit for such a submission 
and will use this working example as a good source of learning for future tasks and projects. And hey, 
hopefully what I learn in the future will better prepare me to try and redo this assignment later on.  


Thank you,

Eric Jostad
