## General Info
A timed quiz that will load onto the webpage and dynamically respond to the quiz-takers input.

The quiz will also store the users score and name, then subsequently add it to the High Scores list. 

If the user runs out of time organically, or causes the timer to hit zero due to negative answers, they 
will receive a "Times up!" message and be invited to try again.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
- [HTML](https://html.com/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)

## Updates planned
- Work-out and deploy solution which will decrement time by 10 seconds when the user selects the incorrect answer.
- Work-out the kinks in the function that calculates the user score.
- Understand and remove bugs from the function that is supposed to allow the user to reset the quiz without refreshing the page. 
- Create code to allow the user to save their score and then append that score to the High Scores area using local storage. 
- Add visible indicators, such as color, when user selects right or wrong answer. 

## Outside resources
This project was used with the knowledge gained from my boot camp, my previous assignments, and a helpful YouTube guid for the overall quiz design. The video can be found here:
